# Would You Rather Project

"Would You Rather...?" is a poll application. You can create two-option polls and answer the ones created by other users.

## Beginning

To install dependencies, run `npm install`. After the dependencies are installed, run `npm start` to initialize the application.

## Logging In/Out

When the application is initialized, a login screen will be displayed. You can select the user to be logged in with from the dropdown and then press "Login". You will be logged in immediately. To logout, just click on "Logout" button within the top navigation bar.

## Dashboard - Home Page

After logging in, the home page - dashboard will be displayed. On the home page, you can see the polls you have not answered yet, by default. You can switch between answered and unanswered polls lists using the tabs. By clicking the button within a poll question, you will be redirected to the question page.

## Question Page

On the question page, you will be shown the options of the questions. If you have not answered the question yet, there will be buttons to select an option. If you have answered the question before - or if you answer the question - you will be shown which option have you selected and how much users selected each option with counts and percentages. Users are not allowed to change their answers and answer more than once.

## Leaderboard

The users are displayed and sorted by total count of polls they created and they answered on the leaderboard page.
